.TH diskcleanup.py
.PP
This script is a very useful utility to help you keep your /var/log directory clean. It is a very powerful utility that has several capabilities. These include:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
Ability to cleanup individual directories (each with unique settings) to delete files older than XX number of days.
.IP \(bu 2
Monitor Log Files and truncate once they reach XX size (MiB, GiB, TiB)
.IP \(bu 2
Cleanup /var/log/audit directory once it achieves XX disk space usage and bring down to 50%.

It is assumed that you will run the script on some cadence using CRON, you can install the files into any directory that you like (ie: /opt/diskcleanup), below is to have the script run every hour (put into /etc/cron.d/diskcleanup

.SH YAML Configuration
.PP
The script reads a YAML configuration file to tell the script all the settings that it needs to know in order to function properly.
.SS Main Section

  cleanup: true 
  abrt_maxage: 30
  abrt_maxsize: 50 MB

Config Parameter	Value	Explanation
abrt_maxage	days	Set max file age of ABRT files
abrt_maxsize	size	Purge if directory over this size (MB or GB)
abrt_directory	directory	Directory of ABRT crash files
cleanup	(true,false)	(this tells the program whether or not to perform cleanup of the /var/log directory)
max_filesize	(KiB,MiB,GiB,TiB)	Sets file Limit Size (There must be space between value and size (i.e.: 2 GiB)
max_fileage	days	Set file Max Age in number of days (i.e.: 30 days)
file_extensions	anything	List of extensions to pay attention to, only will action files matching these extensions
directories\fIto\fPcheck	/var/log	This really should only be set to /var/log
audit_percent	0\-100	Setting this value in (%) percent it will delete files until this percent of disk space is free
log_file	anything	Location to write the log file

.SS Files Section
.PP
This section of the YAML is to list individual files that you want to monitor specifically and the max value setting for this file. If the file reaches over the XX value it will truncate the file to 0 bytes. The table below lists some examples:
.PP
.RS
.nf
files:
  "/var/log/mysqld.log": "2 GiB"
  "/var/log/mysql/mysql\-slow.log" : "3 GiB"
  "/var/log/logstash/logstash\-plain.log": {}
.fi
.RE
.PP
In the above example of files to watch, the following will happen:
\- File /var/log/mysqld.log will be truncated to 0 bytes once it reaches 2 GiB in size.
\- File /var/log/mysql\-slow.log will be truncated to 0 bytes once it reaches 3 GiB in size.
\- File /var/log/logstash/logstash\-plain.log will be truncated to 0 bytes once it reaches whatever the MAX Global setting is configured (max_filesize) which in this case is 2 GiB, so once it reaches 2 GiB it will be truncated.
.SS Directories Section
.PP
This section allows you to specifically individual directories to check across the filesystem and the appropriate configuration settings.
.PP
If you plan to watch multiple file REGEX patterns within a single directory, you will need to use the REGEX | parameter, something like: 
\fBfile\fIpattern: "[logfile1\fP\&.*|filebeat\-.*]"\fP\&. This would look for logs beginning with logfile1_*, or filebeat\-*\&.
.PP
.RS
.nf
directories:
  "/var/log/directory_1":
    file_pattern: "[log_.*\\\\.log]"
  "/var/log/directory_2":
    max_fileage: 3
    file_pattern: "file_.*\\\\.csv"
.fi
.RE
.PP
In the example of directories to watch, the following will happen:
\- Directory /var/log/directory\fI1, any file that matches REGEX pattern will be deleted, since no max\fPfileage was provided it will default to using Global Default [max\fIfileage] which in this case would be 30 days.
\- Directory /var/log/directory\fP2, any file that matches REGEX pattern will be deleted, in this case anything over 3 days.
