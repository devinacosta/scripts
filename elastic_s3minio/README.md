  
This repository contains a set of scripts used to manage Elastic Search Snapshots.

The scripts have been broken out into **client** and **server** scripts. You will find the appropriate files in the following directories.
There is an additional README.md in each of the appropriate directories.

The scripts are written in Python programming language and you will need to install some 3rd party python modules in order for the scripts
to work as expected. Please use the attached **requirements.txt** to install the dependencies before running the scripts.
